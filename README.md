# OpenFlux

**English** | [Русский](README.ru.md)

> **This is a fork** ([wlruscfd/openflux-server](https://github.com/wlruscfd/openflux-server)) of
> [p1neappleXpress/OpenFlux](https://github.com/p1neappleXpress/OpenFlux), kept in sync with it. What it adds:
>
> - `controlplane/` - a multi-user control plane (keys, nodes, traffic, cookie hand-off) with its own Postgres-backed API and panel;
>   `nodeagent/` runs many keys on one exit node (`--managed`), `deployssh/` rolls the controlplane out over SSH.
> - `bridge/` - the gomobile facade the [Android app](https://github.com/wlruscfd/openflux-app) binds (`package mobile`, built by
>   `build_android_aar.sh`); upstream's own bridge stays in `mobile/`.
> - `gateway/` - a userland TUN-to-dialer gateway for the VPN mode.
> - Transports and layers upstream does not have: `mts` (MTS Link Boards), token-keyed end-to-end encryption
>   (`transport/tokenkey.go`, a key's token is the secret) and Yandex self-compression, a raw-socket exit mode with a
>   disjoint port range per key (`--port-range-size`), native Yandex captcha handling with a cookie hand-off from the app.
>
> Sibling repos: [openflux-app](https://github.com/wlruscfd/openflux-app) (Android client),
> [openflux-deploy](https://github.com/wlruscfd/openflux-deploy) (one-command installers for the controlplane and a node).

Network stack research tool. IPv4 TCP/UDP tunnel with pluggable transports,
batched+zstd codec, and two exit-node backends (L3 raw forward / L4 gVisor proxy).

## Architecture

Any client works with either exit backend. `--mode` is chosen on the **exit
node**, not on the client.

```
Client (any):  macOS (utun) / Linux / Windows / iOS (packet tunnel) / Android
                    |
                    v
               Transport (Yandex.Docs / Volga / Board / MAX / Cups / Mail.ru / Direct)
                    |
                    v
               Exit node  -->  Internet
                 --mode l3   (raw SNAT/DNAT, Linux + root)
                 --mode l4   (gVisor proxy, any platform)
```

| Client (any)                            | Exit backend | Requires              |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| macOS / Linux / Windows / iOS / Android | `--mode l3`  | exit on Linux + root  |
| macOS / Linux / Windows / iOS / Android | `--mode l4`  | nothing               |

In `l3`, the exit node terminates nothing: it forwards raw TCP and UDP packets
with SNAT/DNAT (conntrack + egress-IP filter). TCP remains end-to-end between
the client and the real server.

In `l4`, the exit node terminates TCP/UDP in a userspace gVisor stack, then
re-dials the real server. Works on any OS, no root.

The client terminates TCP locally (gVisor, utun, or NEPacketTunnelProvider),
then sends raw IP packets into the transport. In a multi-transport session
several transports run at once and traffic fails over between them (see
[Multi-transport sessions](#multi-transport-sessions)).

## Exit-node backends

The exit node has exactly **two** backends, selected with `--mode` on the
**exit node**. The client does not choose a backend - the same client works
against either.

| `--mode` | Backend | Forwarding | Requires | Platforms |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| `l3` | Raw L3 | SNAT/DNAT on raw IPv4 via SOCK_RAW + conntrack. No userspace TCP stack. | root / CAP_NET_RAW | Linux only |
| `l4` (alias `proxy`) | gVisor proxy | Terminates TCP/UDP in a userspace gVisor stack, then dials the real server. | nothing | Linux, macOS, Windows |

- `proxy` is a deprecated alias for `l4`; both select the same backend.
  `l4` is the canonical name going forward.
- **l3 is faster** (single end-to-end TCP connection, no double termination)
  but Linux-only and needs root.
- **l4 works everywhere** without root, at the cost of terminating TCP twice
  (client -> gVisor on exit -> real server).
- On Linux with root, prefer `l3`. On Windows, the intended path is `l3`
  inside a lightweight QEMU VM (see TODO) - the WinDivert backend is not wired
  yet, and `l4` is the working fallback until QEMU is shipped. On non-root
  hosts, use `l4`.

### l3 and kernel RSTs

In `l3` mode the kernel sees return packets for connections it never opened
and emits RSTs, tearing the tunnel connections down. Drop them:

```
# Scoped (recommended): assign a dedicated egress IP, run with --local-ip, then:
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST -s <egress-ip> -j DROP

# Host-wide fallback (drops ALL outbound RST; makes closed ports look filtered):
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP
```

Client-originated RSTs are forwarded normally. The rule above is only for
RSTs generated locally by the exit-node kernel.

## Highlights

- **Pluggable transports** - Yandex.Docs (WS), Yandex Volga (HTTP relay + WS),
  Yandex Board (WS), MAX/OneMe (WebRTC DataChannel), Cups.online (Centrifugo
  rooms), Mail.ru Docs (WS), Direct (plain TCP to the exit, sessions only).
- **Batched + zstd codec** - coalesces many tunnel packets into a single
  transport message. Fewer channel messages, higher throughput. See
  `transport/batched.go` and `transport/framing.go`.
- **IPv4 UDP** - L4 forwarding and SOCKS5 `UDP ASSOCIATE` have local echo
  coverage. Linux raw L3 UDP remains experimental; see the limitations below.
- **Authenticated sessions** - opt-in `--negotiate` inside encryption, with
  fresh session challenges, packet limits and replay checks. A restarted client
  or exit is accepted again after proving a fresh challenge, so the other side
  keeps running. The old unauthenticated wire-v3 startup option is retired.
  Legacy mode is unchanged.
- **Multi-transport sessions** - `--transports=direct:100,yandex:50` (or
  `[Transport]` sections in a `.conf`) runs every transport at once. Traffic
  uses the highest-priority transport that actually reaches the peer and fails
  over when it stops. See [Multi-transport sessions](#multi-transport-sessions).
- **Captcha handling** - Yandex's proof-of-work captcha is solved
  automatically. SmartCaptcha and login walls go to the app over IPC; the ones
  the exit hits are relayed to the client over any working transport, together
  with a local proxy that lets the app pass them from the exit's own address.
  See [Captchas](#captchas).
- **Two exit backends** - `l3` (raw SNAT/DNAT) and `l4` (gVisor proxy).
  See [Exit-node backends](#exit-node-backends).
- **macOS utun client** - `--inbound=tun` (default on macOS). Creates a utun
  interface, watches its own sockets to install bypass routes, then takes
  the default route. No SOCKS5, no gVisor on the client.
- **Windows tun client** - `--inbound=tun` on Windows uses a Wintun adapter
  (needs administrator and `wintun.dll` next to the binary) for the same
  full-tunnel behavior as the macOS client: the core's own sockets are bound
  to the real interface so carriers never loop into the tunnel, IPv6 is
  routed into the adapter and dropped so programs fall back to IPv4, and the
  routes only live as long as the adapter.
- **iOS packet tunnel** - NEPacketTunnelProvider, pure L3 forwarding.
- **Node provisioning wizard** - `--node-wizard` runs a JSON-over-stdin/stdout
  protocol (one object per line) for a desktop app to provision a new exit
  node over SSH non-interactively: it drives `provision/` to connect, has the
  VDS download and verify a pinned, hash-checked install script, and returns
  the finished node's `openflux://` link. A channel carries any mix of a
  Yandex document, a Mail.ru public document and cups.online rooms (the
  wizard creates them), with direct always as the backup. Optionally
  `openflux-node-update.timer` keeps the server's core on the newest
  `node-v*` release: every 6 hours it checks GitHub, verifies the core
  against the release's own `node-install.sh` and `SHA256SUMS`, restarts
  the channels and rolls back (and skips that release) if one does not stay
  up. `repo=owner/name` in `/etc/openflux-node/update.conf` points it at
  another repository's releases. Secrets (SSH/sudo passwords, the
  private key, the channel key) only ever travel on stdin, never on the
  command line or in a log.
- **Legacy codec** - `--codec=legacy` reverts to the old per-packet LZ4 codec
  (compatible with older clients).
- **Optional encryption** - `--encryption-key-file` wraps the transport in
  AES-256-GCM. Both peers must share the secret.
- **Benchmark modes** - `--role=bench-send --bench-bytes=N` / `--role=bench-sink`
  measure raw goodput through the transport without touching the host network.

## Requirements

1. **Go** - to build the desktop client / exit-node binary. See `go.mod` for
   the exact version.
2. **Android NDK r27+** - to build the Android client binary.
3. **Xcode 26.6+** - to build the iOS client binary.
4. **A Linux VPS / VDS** for the exit node. The `l3` backend requires root;
   `l4` works without.

## Build

```
go mod tidy
go build -o openflux .
```

Cross-build for the exit node (Linux amd64), stripped:

```
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 \
    go build -ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath -o openflux-linux .
```

## Usage

### Exit node - L3 (Linux, root)

```
sudo ./openflux --role=exit --mode=l3 \
    --transport=yandex \
    --url="YOUR_YANDEX_DOC_URL"
```

Requires root / CAP_NET_RAW. Install the iptables rule (see
[l3 and kernel RSTs](#l3-and-kernel-rsts)).

### Exit node - L4 (any OS, no root)

```
./openflux --role=exit --mode=l4 \
    --transport=yandex \
    --url="YOUR_YANDEX_DOC_URL"
```

Fallback for platforms where `l3` is unavailable (Windows without WinDivert,
macOS, non-root Linux). Slower than `l3` (double TCP termination).

### Client - macOS utun (default on macOS)

```
sudo ./openflux --role=client --inbound=tun \
    --transport=yandex \
    --url="YOUR_YANDEX_DOC_URL"
```

Creates a utun interface, installs bypass routes for the transport, waits for
the transport to connect, then takes the default route. No SOCKS5.
Requires sudo. All traffic except the transport goes through the tunnel.

### Client - Windows tun (Wintun, needs administrator)

```
./openflux --role=client --inbound=tun \
    --transport=yandex \
    --url="YOUR_YANDEX_DOC_URL"
```

Needs `wintun.dll` next to the binary (or on `PATH`) and an elevated
(administrator) prompt. Same full-tunnel behavior as the macOS client: no
SOCKS5, all traffic except the transport goes through the tunnel.

### Client - SOCKS5 (all platforms, fallback)

```
./openflux --role=client --inbound=socks5 \
    --transport=yandex \
    --url="YOUR_YANDEX_DOC_URL" \
    --socks5=:1080
```

Point your browser / app at `127.0.0.1:1080` as a SOCKS5 proxy. This is the
default inbound on non-macOS platforms. UDP-capable applications may use the
SOCKS5 `UDP ASSOCIATE` command.

### UDP limitations

- UDP is IPv4-only for now.
- L3 reassembles IPv4 fragments with a 30-second fixed lifetime, 64 incomplete
  datagrams, 128 fragments per datagram and a 4 MiB byte budget per direction.
  Overlaps and malformed fragments are discarded; expiry is swept on input.
- L3 relays checksum-validated ICMP errors only for live TCP/UDP NAT flows,
  restoring the quoted client address/port and checksums. Redirects and echo
  traffic are not relayed. Egress EMSGSIZE produces ICMP fragmentation-needed
  with the kernel route MTU; non-DF packets can instead be fragmented. Outgoing
  fragmentation of IPv4 headers containing options is not supported.
- This is ICMP-based PMTU feedback, not active DPLPMTUD probing. Networks that
  filter ICMP can still black-hole large DF packets; real-network tests remain
  necessary. The negotiated packet ceiling is distinct from the Internet MTU.
- Linux raw L3 UDP reserves a kernel-selected source port per remote endpoint
  using a real UDP socket and restores the client's port on return. This avoids
  taking ports owned by host applications and is intended to prevent kernel
  ICMP port-unreachable without firewall changes. There are at most 256 mappings;
  idle expiry is 2 minutes (15 seconds for DNS). Source-port preservation and
  endpoint-independent NAT/hole-punching are not provided.
- The isolated Linux raw-socket/ICMP test passes in GitHub Actions. It covers
  loopback inside a disposable network namespace, including host-port conflicts
  and false ICMP port-unreachable responses; it is not an Internet/PMTU canary.
  TCP's existing raw-port ownership and RST-suppression requirements are unchanged.
- iOS keeps the old TCP fallback for non-DNS UDP unless the app explicitly
  calls `OpenFluxTunSetUDPEnabled(1)` for a known UDP-capable exit. Reset it to
  `0` when switching to an older exit. Physical-device QUIC is not validated.
- Most document/WebSocket transports are reliable and ordered. UDP works over
  them, but packet loss in the carrier can still cause head-of-line blocking;
  this is not equivalent to a native datagram transport.

### Codec selection

By default the transport uses the batched + zstd codec
(`transport/batched.go` + `transport/framing.go`). For the old per-packet
LZ4 codec, pass `--codec=legacy`:

```
./openflux --role=client --codec=legacy ...
```

**Important:** batched and legacy LZ4 codecs remain incompatible. Default
batched mode remains v2. The old `OPENFLUX_EXPERIMENTAL_WIRE_V3=1` prototype
now fails startup rather than accepting unauthenticated capability messages.

### Authenticated capability negotiation (opt-in CLI)

Add these options on **both** updated peers, using the same secret and codec:

```
--codec=batched --encryption-key-file=/path/to/secret.txt --negotiate
```

The handshake runs inside AES-GCM and confirms fresh random challenges, peer
roles, IPv4/TCP/UDP support, ICMP-error support and maximum IPv4 packet size.
L4 does not advertise raw ICMP forwarding. Only the intersection of capabilities
is enabled. Data carries both session IDs and a sequence number; a
4096-packet sliding replay window tolerates bounded reordering. The old batch-v2 envelope
and encryption key derivation are unchanged; this is not forward secrecy or a
replacement for a future key-exchange/rekey design.

Negotiated mode never falls back to unencrypted or legacy peers. The client
gives up after 20 seconds if negotiation cannot complete (wrong key,
incompatible codec, missing option, or unavailable peer); the exit waits for a
client indefinitely. `--max-packet-size=1280..65000` caps the
complete IPv4 packet; the default is 65000, leaving room for authenticated
envelopes. The agreed limit is used by the gVisor link; the macOS TUN remains
1280. Raw-exit replies exceeding the agreed limit are fragmented without DF,
or produce ICMP feedback to the Internet sender with DF.

Carrier reconnects keep the session. A restarted peer is accepted again without
restarting the other one: a hello from an unknown sender gets a challenge
minted for it alone, and the session is replaced only once that challenge is
echoed, so old traffic replayed from a carrier (anyone with access to a
document sees the ciphertext) cannot displace it. An exit therefore serves one
active client at a time. A client whose exit went silent on every transport
starts a new handshake on its own, within about a minute. Existing iOS builds
have no negotiation setting and must use an exit without `--negotiate`. Their
UDP switch remains manual. No claim of device-level QUIC validation is made.

### Multi-transport sessions

Run several transports in one negotiated session, for example a direct TCP
connection to the exit plus a Yandex document as the fallback:

```
# Exit: direct listener on :8445 plus the document
./openflux --role=exit --mode=l3 --negotiate \
    --transports=direct:100,yandex:50 --direct-listen=0.0.0.0:8445 \
    --encryption-key-file=secret.txt --url="YOUR_YANDEX_DOC_URL"

# Client
./openflux --role=client --inbound=socks5 --negotiate \
    --transports=direct:100,yandex:50 --direct-dial=EXIT_IP:8445 \
    --encryption-key-file=secret.txt --url="YOUR_YANDEX_DOC_URL"
```

- Every transport starts at once. One that fails to start (for example on a
  captcha) is retried in the background with backoff.
- Priority is the failover order: traffic uses the highest-priority transport
  that reaches the peer. Transports with equal priority share flows.
- A transport counts as working only while the peer is heard on it (quiet ones
  are pinged), not merely while it is attached to its document. Peers that
  predate this keep the old behavior.
- Transports are named after their type. Per-type document URLs:
  `--yandex-url`, `--vyandex-url`, `--boards-url`, `--mailru-url`,
  `--cupsonline-url`; MAX takes `--oneme-token` / `--oneme-uid`. `--url` is
  used for `yandex` when `--yandex-url` is empty.
- `--url` is also the encryption context: give both peers the same `--url`.
- `direct` needs the exit's port reachable from the client (open it in the
  firewall); it is only available in a session.

The same setup as a `.conf` file (`./openflux --config=client.conf`; flags on
the command line override the file):

```
[Interface]
Role = client
Inbound = socks5
EncryptionKeyFile = secret.txt
URL = YOUR_YANDEX_DOC_URL

[Transport "direct"]
Priority = 100
Dial = EXIT_IP:8445

[Transport "yandex"]
Priority = 50
URL = YOUR_YANDEX_DOC_URL
```

`[Interface]` keys: `Role`, `Inbound`, `Transport`, `Mode`, `Codec`, `Socks5`,
`EncryptionKeyFile`, `CookieStore`, `IPCSocket`, `URL`, `Debug`. Transport
sections take `Type` (defaults to the section name), `Priority` (default 50),
`URL`, `Dial` / `Listen` (direct) and `Token` / `UID` (MAX). A `.conf` with
transport sections always runs as a negotiated session.

### Sharing an exit with a QR code

Start the exit with `--share` to print an `openflux://` link and its QR code
(in the terminal or the service log). A client scans it, or opens the link,
and gets the exit's transports, priorities, session mode, key and encryption
context, with `direct` pointing at the exit:

```
./openflux --role=exit --mode=l3 --negotiate \
    --transports=direct:100,yandex:50 --direct-listen=0.0.0.0:8445 \
    --encryption-key-file=secret.txt --url="YOUR_YANDEX_DOC_URL" \
    --share --share-host=EXIT_PUBLIC_IP
```

- The link contains the encryption key: treat it and the QR code like the
  key file.
- `--share-host` is the address clients dial for `direct`; by default the
  first public IPv4 of the host.
- MAX is left out (a token belongs to one account), and so is Cups.online
  when its rooms are created at startup.
- Format and QR rendering live in the `share` package (`Encode`, `Decode`,
  `PNG`, `Bitmap`, `Terminal`), for apps to use as well.

### Mode without a server (a PHP node on any web hosting)

Instead of a VDS with a binary, the exit can be a small PHP program on an
ordinary web hosting (free or paid: anything with PHP and FTP/FTPS). The client
and the node meet in a cups.online room or a Mail.ru document, so the hosting
never has to accept a connection and, from a network where only the channel
opens, only the channel has to be reachable. TCP only (ports 80 and 443 at the
exit), no key: the content stays protected by the apps' own TLS, and the hosting
sees where you go. Flow control keeps a saturated carrier from starving
handshakes. Sources and notes: [deploy/phpbox](deploy/phpbox/README.md).

```
# the client, as SOCKS5 and HTTP proxies, or as the system's full tunnel (utun/Wintun)
./openflux --role=client --mode=stream --transport=cupsonline \
    --url "https://interview.cups.online/live-coding/?room=<uuid>" --socks5 127.0.0.1:1080 --http-proxy 127.0.0.1:1081
sudo ./openflux --role=client --mode=stream --inbound=tun --transport=mailru --url "https://cloud.mail.ru/public/..."
```

- **Putting the node on a hosting** is one of the apps' wizards ("Без сервера") or
  the same steps from a script: `--node-wizard` speaks `php.probe`, `php.deploy`,
  `php.check`, `php.start`, `php.stop`, `php.node`, `php.newRoom`, `php.link`,
  `php.remove` (JSON lines; the answers are codes, see `provision/phphost`). Android
  calls `PhpCall`, iOS `OpenFluxPhpCall`. The FTP password goes only through the pipe.
- **Clients in the apps**: `mobile.StartStreamProxy` / `StartStreamPacket`,
  `OpenFluxStartStreamClient` / `OpenFluxStartStreamPacketTunnel`. A link or QR for the
  mode has `"mode":"stream"` (`share.ModeStream`) and one carrier.
- **Full tunnel** (`tunnel.StreamNet`): packets go into a local stack that opens a
  stream per TCP connection; DNS is answered locally with fake addresses and the name is
  opened at the exit. QUIC, other UDP and IPv6 are dropped, so browsers fall back to TCP.
- `-d` / `-dd` / `-ddd` work here like in the packet modes: `[STREAM] -> 526 bytes - stream 7 DATA`.

### Captchas

- **Proof-of-work captcha** (`showcaptchafast`) is solved by the transport
  itself, nothing to do.
- **SmartCaptcha or a login wall on the client's own transport**: with
  `--ipc-socket=PATH` the core asks the app (`CookiesRequest`), the app opens
  the page in a browser view and answers with the cookies (`CookiesOffer`);
  the transport applies them and reconnects.
- **The same on the exit**: the exit reports it to the client as a control
  message over any transport that still works (for example `direct` while the
  document is the one stuck). The client passes it to the app as a
  `CookiesRequest` with `remote: true` and `proxy`: a local HTTP proxy whose
  connections leave through the tunnel and the exit, so the check is passed
  from the exit's address. The app answers with `remote: true` and the exit
  applies the cookies. The proxy's TCP stack shares the tunnel address and uses
  local ports 12000-12999.
- In practice a real browser coming from the exit's address is usually let
  straight through to the document (the captcha targets the transport's HTTP
  client), so loading the page and sending its cookies is typically enough.
- Cookies are persisted in `--cookie-store` (default
  `./cookies-<transport>.json`) and reused after restarts. Under systemd with
  `ProtectSystem=strict`, point it at a writable directory.

### Encryption (optional)

```
./openflux ... --encryption-key-file=/path/to/secret.txt
```

Both peers must use the same secret file. AES-256-GCM, directional keys.
Unset means unencrypted, unchanged behavior.

### Benchmarks

Measure raw goodput through the transport, without touching the host network:

```
# Sender: push 100 MB
./openflux --role=bench-send --bench-bytes=100 --transport=yandex --url="..."

# Receiver: measure goodput
./openflux --role=bench-sink --transport=yandex --url="..."
```

### Other transports

```
# Yandex Volga (HTTP relay + WS)
./openflux --role=exit --mode=l3 --transport=vyandex --url="..." --debug

# MAX / OneMe (WebRTC DataChannel)
./openflux --role=exit --mode=l3 --transport=oneme \
    --maxToken="..." --maxUid="..." --debug

# Cups.online (Centrifugo rooms)
./openflux --role=exit --mode=l3 --transport=cupsonline --debug
# prints a base64 room list; pass it to the client via --url

# Yandex Board (WS)
./openflux --role=exit --mode=l3 --transport=boards --url="..." --debug

# Mail.ru Docs (WS)
./openflux --role=exit --mode=l3 --transport=mailru \
    --url="YOUR_MAILRU_PUBLIC_LINK" --debug
# accepts either a bare weblink (AbCdEfGh1/IjKlMnOp2) or a full URL
# (https://cloud.mail.ru/public/AbCdEfGh1/IjKlMnOp2)
```

## Implementing custom transports

Implement the `Transport` interface from `transport/transport.go` and register
your transport in `transport_factory.go` (sessions, `--transports`) and in the
`--transport` switch in `main.go` (single-transport mode); see
`transport/mailru/` for a complete example. The batched codec
(`BatchedTransport`) wraps any transport, so a new backend gets batching for
free. To take part in captcha handling, also implement
`transport.ErrorNotifier` and `transport.CookieExchanger`.

## TODO

- **L3 exit on Windows and macOS.** The L3 exit currently works on Linux
  (SOCK_RAW) only; Windows and macOS use `--mode=l4`. The `tunnel/windivert/`
  package (Windows) exists but is not wired to the L3 forwarder yet. A native
  macOS L3 exit is not implemented.
- **Run the exit node (QEMU).**
